## Overview
The purpose of this module is to implement two clustering algorithms (k-means, DBScan) on the feature vectors generated in lab 1. This module is built on the preprocessing module that sanitized a set of SGML documents representing a Reuters article database into a dataset of feature vectors and class labels. The results of the clustering algorithms will be employed in future assignments for automated categorization, similarity search, and building document graphs.

## Description
This python module contains the following files and directories:

* lab2.py - main module for KDD process
* preprocessing/
    * \_\_init\_\_.py
    * preprocessing.py - module for preprocessing the Reuters article database
    * document/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * document.py - sub-module for text extraction & tokenization of document objects
    * lexicon/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * lexicon.py - sub-module for generating the title/body lexicon for document set 
    * feature/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * feature.py - sub-module for generating feature vector datasets
        * weighting.py - sub-module for computing tf-idf scores
        * featureselect.py - sub-module for feature selection/reduction

        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * crossvalidator.py - submodule containing functionality for cross validation

        * decisiontree.py - submodule for decision tree classification 
        * bayesian.py - submodule for multinomial naive bayes classification
* clustering/
    * \_\_init\_\_.py
    * clustering.py - module for clustering Reuters Article database
    * algorithm/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * kmeans.py
        * dbscan.py
* data/
    * reut2-xxx.sgm - formatted articles (replace xxx from {000,...,021})

The `preprocessing.py` file will generate the following files

* dataset1.csv - regular feature vector set
* dataset2.csv - pared down version of feature vector in dataset1.csv

The feature vectors in the datasets were generated using the following methodologies

* TF-IDF of title & body words to select the top 5 words of each document features
* Feature reduction process of paring down original feature vector to 10% original size

Potential additional to future iterations of feature vector generation:

* different normalization
* bigram/trigram/n-gram aggregation
* stratified sampling: starting letter, stem, etc.
* binning: equal-width & equal-depth (grouping by topics/places, part-of-speech, etc)
* entropy-based discretization (partitioning based on entropy calculations)

The `clustering.py` file will produce the following 2x2x2 experiment results:

* k-means using euclidean distance on the standard feature vector
* k-means using euclidean distance on the pared feature vector
* DBScan using euclidean distance on the standard feature vector
* DBScan using euclidean distance on the pared feature vector

## Usage
This module relies on several libraries to perform preprocessing, before anything:

Ensure NLTK is installed and the corpus and tokenizers are installed:

```
> pip install NLTK
```

Next, enter a Python shell and download the necessary NLTK data:

```
> python
$ import nltk
$ nltk.download()
```

From the download window, ensure `punkt`, `wordnet` and `stopwords` are downloaded onto your machine.

```

Next, ensure BeautifulSoup4 is installed:

```
> pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Lastly, ensure scikit-learn is installed:

```
> pip install scikit-learn
```

To run the code, first ensure the `lab4.py` file has execute privileges:

```
> chmod +x lab4.py
```

Next, ensure the `preprocessing/` and `clustering/` directories and their filetrees are correct with respect to `lab4.py` (based on the file tree in the overview). Also,
ensure there is a `data/` directory in the same folder as `preprocess.py` and the `data/` directory containing the `reut2-xxx.sgm` files is present. To begin preprocessing the data, run:

```
> python lab4.py
```

or

```
> ./lab4.py
```

The preprocessing and clustering might take some time to complete.

Once `preprocessing.py` finishes execution, two datasets files are generated (`dataset1.csv`, `dataset2.csv`) in the `/datasets` directory. To view these datasets, run:

```
> less datasets/datasetX.csv
```

where `X` is replaced with 1 or 2 depending on the dataset.

Once `clustering.py` finishes execution, the results of the 2x2 experiments will be outputted to the terminal.

## Development
* This module was developed using python 2.7.10 using the NLTK and BeautifulSoup4 modules.

### Adding More Feature Vectors
* Update the \_\_select\_features method in feature.py to extract a new list of feature vector & append to self.features 

### Adding More Clustering
* Add a new .py file to the clustering/algorithm directory
* Ensure this new clustering algorithm is a class with a construct and at least one method:
    * generate_clusters(training)
* Import the algorithm in clustering.py, add an instance of the algorithm to @clusterings, and the print strings
